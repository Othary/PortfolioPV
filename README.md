# My Personal Photography Portfolio:

![01ProjectImg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65731630/221317530-c3aa72db-f73b-4fbb-a117-6f97a1cb834b.jpg)

## About The Project:

The portfolio was made with the purpose to make customers aware of my main target in the photography business
and inform them about prices and shooting options.

### The common funtionalities:

•	Responsive design

• Smooth scroll

• Personally-made slider which shows 3 pictures at the same time translating the main one to the background as well.

• Contact form 

### Main Challanges

• The greatest issue was fixing the small barely distinguished lag between changing slides and the render.  
  And with the easiest solution found is just to change the `useEffect` hook to `useLayoutEffect`. (Who could possibly guess?)
  
• Working with coordinates `getBoundingClientRect` and making smooth and precise transitions and scaling of images.

• Redesigning the slider for the mobile version without losing the main visual feature.

• Creating a perfect colour balance for the whole website based on the main images' colours.

• Advance use of tailwind features to implement the synchronous transition of the main image and the background.
